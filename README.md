## About

Solutions to Advent of Code (AoC) 2022 using the [Dart](https://dart.dev/)

try the language out.

## Solution Code

The source code for each day and part is linked below:

**Day 01**

- [Day 01 Part 01](./lib/day01/day_01_part_01.dart)
- [Day 01 Part 02](./lib/day01/day_01_part_02.dart)

## Running the Code

The setup has been created using the `dart create` command - but is work in
progress on how the puzzles are going to be added and managed each day.
