Solutions for Advent of Code puzzles: https://adventofcode.com/2022

## About

Solutions to Advent of Code (AoC) 2022 using the [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
language. Not used Dart much before so using the puzzles as an opportunity to
try the language out.

## Solution Code

The source code for each day and part is linked below:

**Day 01**

Figuring out the Dart language to acheive what I wanted was the trickiest part,
but learnt a lot in the process.

- [Day 01 Part 01](./lib/day01/day_01_part_01.dart)
- [Day 01 Part 02](./lib/day01/day_01_part_02.dart)

**Day 02**

Solved it ok - but the code feels like a lot of compromises and very messy!
Progress with Dart is ok, but frustrating still.

- [Day 02 Part 01](./lib/day02/day_02_part_01.dart)
- [Day 02 Part 02](./lib/day02/day_02_part_02.dart)

## Running the Code

The setup has been created using the `dart create` command - but is work in
progress on how the puzzles are going to be added and managed each day.
Currently it should work using the following instructions:

1. Download and install the [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart);
2. Clone this GitHub repo to your computer:
   `git clone https://github.com/wiremoons/AdventOfCode2022.git`;
3. Change into the cloned repos directory and run: `dart run`.
